    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This recipe shows the basic steps to making classic, old-school macaroni and cheese. The adjustable aspect comes
        in when you decide how much pasta to boil. Most mac and cheese recipes that use this amount of cheese sauce call
        for 8-ounces of dry elbow macaroni. This makes for a very rich, cheesy, and gooey casserole that yields about 4
        portions. </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>3-4 cups of grated sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cayenne</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp white pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>pinch of nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs plus 1 tbsp butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring
        occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>

        <li>Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. When butter starts to foam and bubble, stir in flour;
        cook on medium heat until flour begins to turn pale yellow, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add thyme, cayenne, and white pepper; cook and stir another minute, then whisk in 1 cup milk until smooth. Pour
        in remaining milk and whisk again. Bring sauce just to a simmer.</li>

        <li>Stir in salt, Worcestershire sauce, and nutmeg. Simmer, whisking often, on medium-low heat until thickened,
        about 8 minutes.</li>

        <li>Turn heat off, then add 2 1/4 cups Cheddar cheese; stir until melted and combined. Mix in Dijon mustard.</li>

        <li>Transfer macaroni into a 8x8-inch casserole dish, then pour in cheese sauce; stir to thoroughly combine pasta
        with sauce.</li>

        <li>Mix together panko bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon melted butter in a small bowl.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle mixture over macaroni and cheese. Sprinkle remaining 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese on top.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>


    </ol>
